Sure, I can assist you with learning and working with Rust. Here's how I can help:

1. **Teaching Rust Concepts**: I can explain Rust concepts, from basic syntax and data types to advanced topics like concurrency, error handling, and performance optimization. Just use the `/learn` command followed by the topic you want to learn about. For example, `/learn Ownership`.

2. **Rust Quizzes**: I can generate Rust quizzes to test your understanding of the language. Use the `/quiz` command to generate a quiz. You can specify the difficulty level with `-work` for working-level questions or `-expert` for expert-level questions. For example, `/quiz -expert`.

3. **Project Ideas**: I can provide practical project ideas based on your knowledge level. Use the `/proj` command followed by `-work` for working-level projects or `-expert` for expert-level projects. For example, `/proj -work`.

4. **Rust Resources**: I have a list of useful Rust resources, including blogs, books, and online communities. You can access these resources using the `/rust-resources` command.

5. **Summarizing Content**: I can provide a detailed summary of a given text or link. Use the `/summary` command followed by the text or link you want to summarize. For example, `/summary https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/`.

6. **Web Search**: I can search the web for information related to Rust. Use the `/search` command followed by your query. For example, `/search Rust concurrency`.

7. **Language Configuration**: You can change the language of the assistant using the `/language` command followed by the language you want to switch to. For example, `/language Chinese`.

8. **Configuration**: You can configure your preferences using the `/config` command.

Remember, you can always use the `/list` command to see a list of all the commands I support along with their descriptions. Let's start learning Rust!
